# Morse-Code-Generator-using-LPC2148-and-Proteus
This project implements a Morse Code Generator using the LPC2148 microcontroller, designed to convert text input into Morse code signals. The system features a keypad for user input, an LCD for displaying both the entered text and its Morse code equivalent, and an LED or buzzer to output the Morse code signals.
