# Morse-Code-Generator-using-LPC2148-and-Proteus
This project implements a Morse Code Generator using the LPC2148 microcontroller, designed to convert text input into Morse code signals. The system features a keypad for user input, an LCD for displaying both the entered text and its Morse code equivalent, and an LED or buzzer to output the Morse code signals.

Introduction 🔍
The Morse Code Generator project aims to develop an embedded system that converts text input into Morse code signals. It utilizes the LPC2148 microcontroller, a keypad for text input, an LCD for displaying the input text and corresponding Morse code, and either an LED or buzzer for generating Morse code signals. 🎛️💡

Objectives ✅
Interface a keypad with the LPC2148 microcontroller to input text characters in Proteus Software.
Display the input text and corresponding Morse code on an LCD. 📺
Develop a software algorithm to convert text characters into Morse code accurately. 🔣➡️🔊
Generate Morse code signals through visual (LED) or audio (buzzer) outputs with correct timing for dots, dashes, and spaces. 🔴🔔
Implement I2C protocol to facilitate communication between the microcontroller and the LCD or other I2C-enabled peripherals. 🔗
Utilize Keil uVision 4 for developing, debugging, and testing the microcontroller firmware to ensure the system functions correctly in real-time. 💻🐞
